1) this is normally builtwith Mono 2.8.x. It will probably build with
.net, however there may be unresolved library issues.

As such you will need to have Mono 2.8 installed, and the rest of these
insttruction are predicated on it being in your path

2)xbuild is the command that will build the set up

by default it will build the debug libraries, if you pass 
"/property:Configureation=release" it will build release 
libraries(trace/debug disabled, optimize enabled)

3) the current build structure is root is the location of the .sln file,

root/lib/debug are the debug class libraries
root/lib/release are the release class libraries
root/bin/debug are the debug executables 
root/bin/release are the release  executables

depending on how things work out, this may change dramatically

4)cd into the /bin/debug or /bin/release depending on how you built it

5)run the executable using "mono servermain.exe $PATHTOJSONFILE" 
where $PATHTOJSONFILE is where you will put the randomly generated JSON file.

NOTES: this currently has no bulletproofing so handle with care
