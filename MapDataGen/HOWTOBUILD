1)Step 1: this project requires a recent version of mono, 
I would suggest 2.8 you can get mono either from your package manager or from

mono-project.com/mono-downloads/download.html

2.8.2 is the latest stable version and is what I will be compiling agaisnt

2)make sure mono is in your path: depending on your shell either 
which or whence dmcs. dmcs is the C# 4.0 compiler and is neccessary 
for constructing the library

3)build the project: Due to issues with make(see make.sh for details)
my makefile is a shell script.

4)execute the shellscript: chmod +x make.sh, ./make.sh if you forgot

5)should compile. if not, please go yell at Lewisc somehow, 
preferably with an error mssag

Currently this is just a class library, I will stitch together a 
command line tool as soon as I have time
